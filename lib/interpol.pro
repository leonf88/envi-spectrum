; NAME:
;	INTERPOL
;
; PURPOSE:
;	Linearly interpolate vectors with a regular or irregular grid.
;	Quadratic or a 4 point least-square fit to a quadratic
;	interpolation may be used as an option.
;
; CATEGORY:
;	E1 - Interpolation
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	Result = INTERPOL(V, N) 	;For regular grids.
;
;	Result = INTERPOL(V, X, XOUT)	;For irregular grids.
;
; INPUTS:
;	V:	The input vector can be any type except string.
;
;	For regular grids:
;	N:	The number of points in the result when both input and
;		output grids are regular.
;
;	Irregular grids:
;	X:	The absicissae values for V.  This vector must have same # of
;		elements as V.  The values MUST be monotonically ascending
;		or descending.
;
;	XOUT:	The absicissae values for the result.  The result will have
;		the same number of elements as XOUT.  XOUT does not need to be
;		monotonic.  If XOUT is outside the range of X, then the
;		closest two endpoints of (X,V) are linearly extrapolated.
;
; Keyword Input Parameters:
; NAN = if set, then filter out NaN values before interpolating.
;   The default behavior is to include the NaN values - by including NaN's
;   the output will contain NaN's in locations where the interpolation
;   result is undefined.
;   
;	LSQUADRATIC = if set, interpolate using a least squares
;	  quadratic fit to the equation y = a + bx + cx^2, for each 4
;	  point neighborhood (x[i-1], x[i], x[i+1], x[i+2]) surrounding
;	  the interval, x[i] <= XOUT < x[i+1].
;
; 	QUADRATIC = if set, interpolate by fitting a quadratic
; 	  y = a + bx + cx^2, to the three point neighborhood (x[i-1],
; 	  x[i], x[i+1]) surrounding the interval x[i] <= XOUT < x[i+1].
;
;	SPLINE = if set, interpolate by fitting a cubic spline to the
;	  4 point neighborhood (x[i-1], x[i], x[i+1], x[i+2]) surrounding
;	  the interval, x[i] <= XOUT < x[i+1].
;
;	Note: if LSQUADRATIC or QUADRATIC or SPLINE is not set,  the
;	default linear interpolation is used.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;	INTERPOL returns a floating-point vector of N points determined
;	by interpolating the input vector by the specified method.
;
;	If the input vector is double or complex, the result is double
;	or complex.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	None.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;	None.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;	None.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;	For linear interpolation,
;	Result(i) = V(x) + (x - FIX(x)) * (V(x+1) - V(x))
;
;	where 	x = i*(m-1)/(N-1) for regular grids.
;		m = # of elements in V, i=0 to N-1.
;
;	For irregular grids, x = XOUT(i).
;		m = number of points of input vector.
;
;	  For QUADRATIC interpolation, the equation y=a+bx+cx^2 is
;	solved explicitly for each three point interval, and is then
;	evaluated at the interpolate.
;	  For LSQUADRATIC interpolation, the coefficients a, b, and c,
;	from the above equation are found, for the four point
;	interval surrounding the interpolate using a least square
;	fit.  Then the equation is evaluated at the interpolate.
;	  For SPLINE interpolation, a cubic spline is fit over the 4
;	point interval surrounding each interpolate, using the routine
;	SPL_INTERP().
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;	Written, DMS, October, 1982.
;	Modified, Rob at NCAR, February, 1991.  Made larger arrays possible
;		and correct by using long indexes into the array instead of
;		integers.
;	Modified, DMS, August, 1998.  Now use binary intervals which
;		speed things up considerably when XOUT is random.
;       DMS, May, 1999.  Use new VALUE_LOCATE function to find intervals,
;       	which speeds things up by a factor of around 100, when
;       	interpolating from large arrays.  Also added SPLINE,
;       	QUADRATIC, and LSQUADRATIC keywords.
;   CT, ITTVIS, Feb 2009: CR54942: Automatically filter out NaN values.
;     Clean up code.
;   CT, ITTVIS, Feb 2010: CR57403: Back out previous change.
;     Add NAN keyword to control filtering out of NaN's
