; NAME:
;       R_TEST
;
; PURPOSE:
;       This function tests the hypothesis that a binary sequence (a 
;       sequence of 1s and 0s) represents a "random sampling". This
;       test is based on the "theory of runs" and is often refered to
;       as the Runs Test for Randomness. The result is a two-element
;       vector containing the nearly-normal test statistic Z and the 
;       one-tailed probability of obtaining a value of Z or greater.
;
; CATEGORY:
;       Statistics.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       Result = R_test(X)
;
; INPUTS:
;       X:    An n-element vector of type integer, float or double.
;             Elements not equal to 0 or 1 are removed and the length
;             of X is correspondingly reduced.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;       R:    Use this keyword to specify a named variable which returns
;             the number of runs (clusters of 0s and 1s) in X.       
;
;      N0:    Use this keyword to specify a named variable which returns
;             the number of 0s in X.
;
;      N1:    Use this keyword to specify a named variable which returns
;             the number of 1s in X.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;       Define a vector of 1s and 0s.
;         x = [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1]
;
;       Test the hypothesis that x represents a random sampling against the 
;       hypothesis that it does not represent a random sampling at the 0.05 
;       significance level.
;         result = r_test(x, r = r, n0 = n0, n1 = n1)
;
;       The result should be the 2-element vector:
;         [2.26487, 0.0117604]
;       The keyword parameters should be returned as:
;         r = 22.0000, n0 = 16.0000, n1 = 14.0000 
;
;       The computed probability (0.0117604) is less than the 0.05
;       significance level and therefore we reject the hypothesis that x
;       represents a random sampling. The results show that there are too 
;       many runs, indicating a non-random cyclical pattern.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;       R_TEST computes the nonparametric Runs Test for Randomness. A 
;       "run" is a cluster of identical symbols within a sequence of two
;       distinct symbols. The binary sequence (x) defined in EXAMPLE has 
;       22 runs (or clusters). The first run contains one 0, the second 
;       run contains two 1s, the third run contains one 0, and so on.
;       In general, the randomness hypothesis will be rejected if there
;       are lengthy runs of 0s or 1s or if there are alternating patters
;       of many short runs.
