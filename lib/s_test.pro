; NAME:
;       S_TEST
;
; PURPOSE:
;       This function tests the hypothesis that two sample popultions, 
;       {X[i], Y[i]}, have the same mean of distribution against the 
;       hypothesis that they differ. The result is a two-element vector
;       containing the maximum number of signed differences between 
;       corresponding pairs of X[i] and Y[i] and the one-tailed level of
;       significance. This type of test is often refered to as the Sign
;       Test.
;       
; CATEGORY:
;       Statistics.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       Result = S_test(X, Y)
;
; INPUTS:
;       X:    An n-element vector of type integer, float or double.
;
;       Y:    An n-element vector of type integer, float or double.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;   ZDIFF:    Use this keyword to specify a named variable which returns the
;             number of differences between corresponding pairs of X[i] and 
;             Y[i] resulting in zero. Paired data resulting in a difference 
;             of zero are excluded from the ranking and the sample size is 
;             correspondingly reduced.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;       Define the n-element vectors of sample data.
;         x = [47, 56, 54, 49, 36, 48, 51, 38, 61, 49, 56, 52]
;         y = [71, 63, 45, 64, 50, 55, 42, 46, 53, 57, 75, 60]
;       Test the hypothesis that two sample popultions, {X[i], Y[i]}, have 
;       the same mean of distribution against the hypothesis that they differ
;       at the 0.05 significance level.
;         result = s_test(x, y, zdiff = zdiff)
;       The result should be the 2-element vector:
;         [9.00000, 0.0729981]
;       The keyword parameter should be returned as:
;         zdiff = 0
;       The computed probability (0.0729981) is greater than the 0.05 
;       significance level and therefore we do not reject the hypothesis that
;       X and Y have the same mean of distribution.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;       S_TEST computes the nonparametric Sign Test. Differences between 
;       corresponding pairs of X[i] and Y[i] are ranked as either positive or
;       negative with equal probability of occurance. Differences between 
;       pairs of X[i] and Y[i] that result in zero are excluded from the 
;       ranking and the sample size is correspondingly reduced. The result is 
;       a two-element vector [diff, p] containing the maximum number of signed 
;       differences between corresponding pairs of X[i] and Y[i] and the one-
;       tailed level of significance. Using the Binomial random variable X, 
;       we can accept of reject the proposed hypothesis. If the sample size 
;       exceeds 25, then the Gaussian distribution is used to approximate the 
;       cumulative Binomial distribution. The one-tailed probability of
;       obtaining at least (diff) signed differences in an n-element sample is
;       equal to (p). Prob(X >= diff) = p. 
;       The hypothesis that two sample popultions have the same mean
;       of distribution is rejected if the number of positive ranks and the
;       number of negative ranks differ with statistical significance.
