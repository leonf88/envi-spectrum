; NAME:
;	RESOLVE_ALL
;
; PURPOSE:
;	Resolve (by compiling) all procedures and functions.
;	This is useful when preparing .sav files containing all the IDL
;	routines required for an application.
; CATEGORY:
;	Programming.
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	RESOLVE_ALL
; INPUTS:
;	None.
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;	CLASS = if set, a list of object class names. RESOLVE_ALL's rules
;	    for finding uncompiled functions and procedures are not able to
;	    find object definitions or methods, because those things are not
;	    known to IDL until the object classes are actually instantiated
;	    and the methods called. However, if CLASS is set, RESOLVE_ALL
;	    will ensure that the __DEFINE files for those classes and their
;	    superclasses are compiled and execute. If then locates all methods
;	    for those classes and their superclasses and makes sure they are
;	    also compiled.
;	CONTINUE_ON_ERROR = if set, continue when a routine fails to
;	    resolve, otherwise throw an error and stop.
;	QUIET = if set, produce no messages.
;	RESOLVE_EITHER = A scalar or array of routine names to resolve.
;	    Use this keyword instead of RESOLVE_FUNCTION or RESOLVE_PROCEDURE
;	    if you do not know the type of the routine being resolved.
;	    If the routines are already compiled, they are not recompiled.
;	RESOLVE_FUNCTION = a scalar or array of function names to resolve.
;	    If the routines are already compiled, they are not recompiled.
;	RESOLVE_PROCEDURE = a scalar or array of procedure names to resolve.
;	    If the routines are already compiled, they are not recompiled.
; 	SKIP_ROUTINES = an optional string array containing the names
; 	    of routines to NOT resolve.  This is useful when a library
; 	    file containing the designated routines will be later included.
;	UNRESOLVED = if CONTINUE_ON_ERROR is set, this output parameter will
;	    contain the names of the unresolved procedures and functions
;	    in a string array.  Routines in the SKIP_ROUTINES list are
;	    also included in this result.
; OUTPUTS:
;	No explicit outputs.
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	None.
; SIDE EFFECTS:
; RESTRICTIONS:
;	Will not resolve procedures or functions that are called via
;	CALL_PROCEDURE, CALL_FUNCTION, or EXECUTE, or object methods.
;	Only explicit calls are resolved.
;
;	If an unresolved procedure or function is not in the IDL
;	search path, an error occurs, and no additional routines
;	are resolved unless CONTINUE_ON_ERROR is specified.
;
;	This routine does not support the idea of a function and procedure
;	both having the same name, and does not handle that case. This is
;	generally not a good idea anyway, as it is confusing.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;	This routine iteratively determines the names of unresolved calls
;	to user-written or library procedures and functions, and then
;	compiles them.  The process stops when there are no unresolved
;	routines. If the CLASS keyword is set, this routine first ensures
;	that all the class definitions are compiled (from the __define.pro)
;	file, and that all methods for those classes and their superclasses
;	are compiled.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;	RESOLVE_ALL.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
; 	Written by:
;	DMS, RSI, January, 1995.
;	DMS, RSI, April, 1997, Added SKIP_ROUTINES keyword.
;	AB, RSI, April 1998, Added CONTINUE_ON_ERROR keyword. Reorganized
;		the body of the resolving code.
;	DMS, Aug, 1998.  Added UNRESOLVED keyword.
;	AB, 13 January 1999, Added RESOLVE_EITHER keyword. Removed the old
;		restriction that only one of the RESOLVE_ keywords are
;		processed in a single call.
;	AB, 6 February 2003, Added CLASS keyword.
;	CT, August 2004: Fix RESOLVE_FUNCTION keyword so it works.
