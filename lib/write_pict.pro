PRO WRITE_PICT, FILE, IMAGE, R, G, B

;+
; NAME:         WRITE_PICT
; PURPOSE:      Writes image files with the current color palette in the PICT
;               Version 2 Format.  This format is used by Apple Macintosh 
;               Computers.
; CATEGORY:     
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       WRITE_PICT, FILE                ;Writes contents of current window
;       WRITE_PICT, FILE, IMAGE         ;Writes given array
;       WRITE_PICT, FILE, IMAGE, R, G, B  ;Writes array w/given color table
; INPUTS:
;       FILE = Scalar string giving the name of the PICT file to write.
;       IMAGE = 2D matrix to be output.  If IMAGE is omitted,
;         the entire current window is read into an array and written
;         to the PICT file.
; OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS:
;       R, G, B = The Red, Green, and Blue color vectors to be written
;               with IMAGE.  If not specified, the current color table is used
; OUTPUTS:
;       FILE contains the image in a PICT version 2 file format.  If color
;       vectors were supplied, they are used. Otherwise, the last color tables
;       established by LOADCT are used (If LOADCT hasn't been used
;       to establish color tables yet it is used to load the B/W tables.).
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;       If R, G, and B aren't supplied and LOADCT hasn't been called yet,
;       this routine uses LOADCT to load the B/W tables.
; RESTRICTIONS:
;       Only creates Version 2 PICT files.  Only works with 8-bit displays
; PROCEDURE:
;       Write out the header, size, and the following quickdraw opcodes:
;               Version, HeaderOp, DefHilite, Clip, and PackBitsRect
;       Then pack the image data using the QUICKDRAW PackBits
;       run length encoding algorithm.
;       Packing method:
;               Each line is preceeded by a byte if the image width
;               is less than 250 or a integer otherwise.  This prefix
;               tells how many bytes are in the packed line to follow.
;               The line following this length descriptor is made up of
;               a series of runs and data as follows:
;       - Runs
;               If there is a run, the high bit of the first byte is 
;               set and the other seven bits tell how many elements are
;               in the run.  The next byte is then the value of the run.
;               Runs can only be 128 bytes in length so longer runs are
;               broken up into smaller runs if they exceed 128 bytes.
;               The smallest run is three bytes.
;       - Data
;               If there are a series of image values that differ at least
;               every two bytes, they are written out after a byte that
;               describes how many dissimilar data bytes are to follow.
;               As with runs, the length of a run of data can not be 
;               longer than 128 without setting the high bit of the
;               length descriptor so long strings of data are broken up
;               into chunks 128 bytes or smaller.
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;       Written 16 November 1990, Steve Richards.
;       SMR, Aug 25, '92        Rewrote the packing routine and fixed bugs.
;       JIY, Mar 30, '92        added fix to work on Ultrix and VMS.
;       SMR, Oct 12, '93        Added changes suggested by Joe Gurman that
;                               prevented the clobbering of color vectors on
;                               exit from the routine.
;       SMR, Jan 12, '94        Added a case for OSF byte ordering, suggested
;                               by Joe Gurman.
;       DMS, Jun 24, 1994       Fixed byte ordering logic.
;                               Added code to clip image to # of colors-1
