; NAME:
;	HILBERT
;
; PURPOSE:
;	Return a series that has all periodic terms shifted by 90 degrees.
;
; CATEGORY:
;	G2 - Correlation and regression analysis
;	A1 - Real arithmetic, number theory.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	Result = HILBERT(X [, D])
;
; INPUT:
;	X:	A floating- or complex-valued vector containing any number
;		of elements.
;
; OPTIONAL INPUT:
;	D:	A flag for rotation direction.  Set D to +1 for a
;		positive rotation.  Set D to -1 for a negative rotation.
;		If D is not provided, a positive rotation results.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;	Returns the Hilbert transform of the data vector, X.  The output is
;	a complex-valued vector with the same size as the input vector.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;	None.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;	HILBERT uses FFT() so this procedure exhibits the same side
;	effects with respect to input arguments as that function.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;	A Hilbert transform is a series	that has had all periodic components
;	phase-shifted by 90 degrees.  It has the interesting property that the
;	correlation between a series and its own Hilbert transform is
;	mathematically zero.
;
;	The method consists of generating the fast Fourier transform using
;	the FFT() function and shifting the first half of the transform
;	products by +90 degrees and the second half by -90 degrees.  The
;	constant elements in the transform are not changed.
;
;	Angle shifting is accomplished by multiplying or dividing by the
;	complex number, I=(0.0000, 1.0000).  The shifted vector is then
;	submitted to FFT() for transformation back to the "time" domain and the
;	output is divided by the number elements in the vector to correct for
;	multiplication effect peculiar to the FFT algorithm.
