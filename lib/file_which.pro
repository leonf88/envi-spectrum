; NAME:
;       FILE_WHICH
;
; PURPOSE:
;       Look in the directories given by a file search path for a
;       specific file.
;
;       This command is modeled after the Unix which(1) command.
;
; CATEGORY:
;       File Manipulation.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       Result = FILE_WHICH([PATH,] FILE)
;
; INPUTS:                 
;       PATH: A search path to be searched.If Path is not
;		present, the value of the IDL !PATH system
;               variable is used.
;       FILE: The file to look for in the directories given by
;               PATH.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;	INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR:
;	If set, include the current working directory at the
;	head of the PATH. This is useful when trying to simulate
;	the way IDL searches for routines, because it looks in the
;	current directory and then looks at the value of !PATH.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;       If the file is found, the full path is returned. If the
;       file is not found, a NULL scalar string is returned.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;       None.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;       The path is separated into it's component directories, and each
;       directory is searched in turn. The first directory that has
;       the file is used. If the file does not exist in any of the
;       directories, a NULL string is returned.
;
; EXAMPLES:
;       To find the location of this routine:
;
;               Result = FILE_WHICH('file_which.pro')
;
;       To find the location of the Unix ls command:
;
;               Result = FILE_WHICH(getenv('PATH'), 'ls')
